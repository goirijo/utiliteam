# Implement a Stack data structure for integers

I've implemented some tests for `IntStack` in `main.cpp`. 
There is also a build script `build.sh`.
You can compile and run the main executable with

```
bash build.sh && ./run
```

The `IntStack` class is currently unimplemented, but declared in `stack.hpp`.
The assignment is to define all the public calls that are declared for `IntStack`.
You can add any number of private functions and data members, but nothing should be added to the public interface.
The assignment is complete when your code compiles, runs, and passes every test in a reasonable amount of time (less than 2 minutes).

You can use anything from the standard template library **except** `std::stack`.
Whoever writes the fastest code gets a candie bar.
